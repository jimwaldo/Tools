A set of utility programs for running classes. All of the programs that
require a roster should use a pickle file of names, of the sort that will
be generated by makeRosterFromCanvas.py.

Contents:

makeRosterFromCanvas.py: A program that reads a Canvas course gradebook export
and generates a pickle file of the roster of student names. This will also
reformat the names from Lastname, Firstname to Firstname Lastname.

toss_dice.py: Simulate the rolling of a number of dice.

flip_coin.py, flip_coin2.py: Simulate the flipping of a coin.

compareLists.py: Compare two csv files and print out the differences. Will
look at only the first entry of the list. Handy for comparing the rosters over
time to see if students have added or dropped.

getRandomEntries.py: Build and print a set of random entries from a pickled list of the
sort produced by makeRosterFromCanvas.py. The first argument is the pickle file containing
the list. The second argument is the name of a pickle file containing the names to be
excluded from the set. The third argument is the number of entries to be generated. Entries
that are picked for the set will be added to the exclude list, which will be written to
a new exclude file with the same name as that given in the second argument.

getRandomSet.py: Build and print a set of random entries from integers 1 to n. The first
argument is the number of integers to be generated, the second is the maximum value of members
of the set. The set is sorted before being printed. If the range is less than the desired
number, an error message is printed.

makeGroups.py: build a set of random entries from a pickled list of entries, designed to be used
with name list of the sort produced by makeRosterFromCanvas.py. The first argument is the pickle file
